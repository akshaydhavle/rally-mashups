I am planning to host all my Rally Mashups here, so its easy to share and provide updates to users. This Mashups are purely HTML files and doesn't contain any company specific data. Please read the comments written on top in mashup file for specific installation steps.

h1. # 1 Scrum Board

h3. Features
# Swimlanes based on Kanban state (not first two due to screen size limitation)
# Darg 'n' Drop feature to move cards from one state to another. It also updates the respective RALLY scheduled state. Mapping is right there in Custom Mashup.
# Defects are with RED border and User Stories are with BLUE border.
# ID, Esimate, Title/Name, Owner and Schedule State are show as card details.
# Total Estimate in Story Points is shows in Swimlane header.
# User can select different sprint from the dropdown menu.
